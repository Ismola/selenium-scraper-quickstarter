- **Fix Timeline**: We will strive to address the vulnerability and release an update within a reasonable timeframe.

## Security Concerns

Given that this project uses Selenium, Flask, and Docker, here are some specific areas of security concern:

### Selenium

- **Access Control**: Ensure that access to the automated browser is restricted and not publicly exposed.
- **File Downloads**: Handle downloaded files carefully to avoid executing malicious code.
- **Browser Configuration**: Use security options like `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-dev-shm-usage` to minimize risks.

### Flask

- **Authentication**: Ensure that authentication tokens are handled securely and not exposed in code or logs.
- **Endpoint Protection**: All endpoints should be protected with proper authentication and authorization.
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.

### Docker

- **Docker Images**: Use official Docker images and keep them updated to avoid known vulnerabilities.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure sensitive environment variables are not exposed in configuration files or logs.
- **Container Permissions**: Run containers with the least privileges necessary to reduce the risk of privilege escalation.

## Security Best Practices

- **Dependency Maintenance**: Keep all dependencies updated to benefit from the latest security patches.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement monitoring tools to detect and respond to suspicious activities in real-time.
